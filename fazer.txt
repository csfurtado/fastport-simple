Scope: individual work Use only authorised targets (CIBERIUM lab machines).
Objective

Build a small orchestration pipeline that automates a basic reconnaissance workflow: quick host discovery (Masscan) → detailed scanning & fingerprinting (Nmap) → basic OSINT collection (theHarvester) → simple aggregation into a single inventory (JSON and CSV). 
Required deliverables 

    A Git repository containing:

        run_recon.sh (or run_recon.py): orchestration script that runs Masscan, Nmap and theHarvester (or the subset you implemented).

        tools/aggregate.py (or equivalent): script that parses outputs and produces an inventory.json.

        targets.txt (or list of authorised targets used).

        out/ directory with the run outputs (masscan.json, nmap/ XML outputs, harvester outputs, inventory.json, CSV).


        Required

            Run Masscan (or skip Masscan and use Nmap directly if preferred) against a single authorised target or small authorised range.

            For discovered hosts/ports run Nmap with service/version detection and save XML (nmap -sC -sV -O -oA).

            Run theHarvester for a provided domain (if available) or run a basic OSINT check (e.g., DNS / subdomain enumeration).

            Implement tools/aggregate.py that:

                parses Nmap XML and Masscan JSON (if present),

                builds inventory.json with at least: host IP → open ports → service/version → hostnames/subdomains (if any),

                exports a CSV summary.

            Produce report.md with screenshot and short analysis.
        Optional extensions (if you feel with energy)

            Map discovered service versions to known CVEs (local lookup or public API).

            Produce a simple Graphviz .dot file to visualise host ↔ services ↔ subdomains relationships.

            Implement diffs: compare current run with a previous run and list changes.

            Integrate basic rate control and safety flags in the orchestration script.
         

        Example commands 

            Masscan quick discovery (example):
             
            sudo masscan -iL targets.txt -p1-65535 --rate 500 -oJ out/masscan.json

            Nmap detailed scan (example):
             
            nmap -sC -sV -O -p- -oA out/nmap/192.168.56.101 192.168.56.101

            theHarvester (example):
             
            theHarvester -d example.lab -b all -f out/harvester/example_lab.html
